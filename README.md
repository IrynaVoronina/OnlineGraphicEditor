# Online Graphic Editor

## Overview

It is a versatile tool designed to create and edit images with ease. It allows users to manipulate images and save them in three popular formats: BMP, PNG, and JPG. With a user-friendly interface, this editor features a toolbox for creating graphical primitives, selecting colors, applying text, and adding basic visual effects such as black and white raster, infrared raster, sepia, and red tint. Additionally, it supports layer functionality for organizing and managing different elements of the image.

The backend of the system is powered by the Spring Framework, integrating well-established design patterns to create a robust and easily maintainable server-side infrastructure. 
(Meanwhile, the frontend is developed using Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework renowned for its simplicity, flexibility, and performance in creating dynamic user interfaces)

## Design Patterns

The project utilizes several design patterns to ensure maintainability and scalability:

- **Proxy**
- **Prototype**
- **Memento**
- **Template Method**
- **Factory Method**

- The API documentation for the backend is available through Swagger. Once the backend server is running, you can access the Swagger UI at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html.
